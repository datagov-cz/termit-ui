# TermIt UI Setup Guide

This guide provides information on how to build and deploy TermIt UI.

## Build

### System Requirements

* NodeJS 9.x or later
* npm 6.x or later

### Setup

To build TermIt for **non**-development deployment, use the `build-prod` npm script.

The following parameters can be configured for the build:

| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `serverUrl` | Specifies the URL where the TermIt backend is running |
| `deployment` | Is used to disambiguate cookies and items in the local storage in case the client accesses multiple TermIt instances
| `controlPanelUrl` | Specifies the URL of the Control panel |
| `REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_URL` | URL of the Keycloak authentication service. Loaded from `.env` on build by default |
| `REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_REALM` | Keycloak Realm used by this application. Loaded from `.env` on build by default |
| `REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_CLIENTID` | Keycloak client ID of this application. Loaded from `.env` on build by default |

### Example

1. `npm install`
2. `serverUrl=https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/termit-server-dev deployment=dev npm run build-prod`

## Deployment

Deployment is fairly simple, just take the content of the `build` folder generated by the build script
and copy it to a location accessible via HTTP(S), e.g., into an Apache HTTP server-managed location.

### Example

`cp -R build /var/www/termit/`
